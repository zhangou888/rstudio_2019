# 1: Welcome and RStudio Vision 

[Tareef Kawaf](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/opening-keynote-tareef-kawaf)


* Three key concepts

* The way of RStudio

* Reproducibility

* Imporantance of 1439 (printing press technology)

* Mass communication

* **Code** is the **reproducibility**, Reproducibility is **good science**, and good science is **good business.**

* If you belileve in the code and reproducibility, you can get **reuse, automation, scheduling, and parametrization**.

### 4 reasons to love code:
* Repeatable  
* Inspectable  
* Reusable  
* Diffable  

### Code Importance

* Complex problems will require code  
* Code is communication, and communication is critical
* With code you can inspect how a problem is solved and either adopt it, or figure out how to improve it yourself.
* With code, the answer is always **YES!!**

# 2: R shiny Keynote Talk

[Joe Cheng](https://speakerdeck.com/jcheng5/)

slide: <https://speakerdeck.com/jcheng5/shiny-in-production>

### rstudio/cranwhales
[cranwhales](https://github.com/rstudio/cranwhales/) is a Shiny example application, meant to demonstrate how to convert synchronous (traditional) Shiny apps to asynchronous ones.

Staging and Production

### Goals:

* **keep it up** 
    -Unplanned outages are rare or nonexistent

* **keep it safe** 
    -Data, functionality, and  code are all kept safe from unauthorized access

* **keep it correct**   
    -works as intended, provide right answers

* **keep it snappy** 
    - Fast response time, ability to predict needed capacity for expected traffic

### New tools for Shiny in production

* Rstudio connenct

* shinytest- automated UI testing for Shiny

* shinyloadtest- load testing for shiny

* profvis - profiler for R

* Plot caching

* Async -last resort technique for dealing with slow operations


### Big Question: **Is Cranwhales fast enough?**

### Performance workflow

1. Using **shinyloadtest** to see if it's fast enough

2. if not, use **profvis** to see what's making it slow.

3. optimize  
  3.1 Move work out of Shiny
  3.2 Make code faster    
  3.3 Use Caching  
  3.4 Use async  

4. Repeat!
    
# 3: Getting it right: Writing reliable and maintainable R code 

[Amanda Gadrow, RStudio ](https://github.com/ajmcoqui)


### Characteristics of good code:

* Reliability

* Reproducibility

* Flexibility

* Longevity

* Scalability

### How do we determine the quality of our code?

1. Execution feedback  
2. User feedback  
3. measure it with **tests**; functional, integration, perfromance.  

make the part of your regular development cycle for;

* faster updates

* R package-**testthat**, **usethis**

* R package-**shinytest**

### Modular design for ease of testing and maintenance

* Decoupling, code isolation
* **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
* **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid
* Consistent code style


* [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)

# 4: A guide to making your data reproducible 

[Karthik Ram](https://github.com/karthik)

### Set up Research compendium principles

1. Stick with the conventions of your peers  
2. Keep data, methods and outputs separate  
3. Specify your computational environment as clearly as you can
    
### Key components you'll need for sharing a compendium

1. licence  
2. VCS  
3. Metadata  

### 3 separate different components ofa compendium

1. Data (Small --> Medium)  
  1.1 Small data: put small data inside packages, especially if you ship a methods package with your analysis  
      1.1.1 CRAN =< 5mb  
  1.2 [**piggyback**](http://github.com/ropensci/piggback) package: Attach large [data] files to Github repositories  
  1.3 Medium data
  [**arkdb**](http://github.com/ropensci/arkdb) package: Attach large [data] files to Github repositories
  

2. Computing environment

* It's important to isolate the computing envrionment so that changes in software dependencies don't break your analysis.

* Adding a Dockerfile to your compendium

Many ways to write a Dockerfile for your project

**o2r/containerit**  
**jupyter/repo2docker**

* API
* metadata (Tidy data)
* tensorflow  
* [Binder](mybinder.org)  
  Binder is an open source project that is designed to make it really easy to share analyses that are in notebooks.

<http://github.com/karthik/rstudio2019>

Git + Docker + RStudio

3. Workflows

Include a workflow to manage relationsihps between data output and code.

# 6: Working with categorical data in R without losing your mind

[Amelia McNamara](http://www.amelia.mn/)

**Slides:** <http://www.amelia.mn/WranglingCats.pdf>

### Factors

R’s representation of categorical data. Consists of: 
 1. A set of **values**
 2. An ordered set of **valid levels**
 
```{r factor, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}

eyes <- factor(x = c("blue", "green", "green"),
               levels = c("blue", "brown", "green"))
eyes

```

### stringAsFactors: An unauthorized biography

Historical view from Roger Peng's [blog](https://simplystatistics.org/2015/07/24/stringsasfactors-an-unauthorized-biography/)

* **Solution** : Use **Tidyverse** family read_csv() function instead of read.csv()
 
* But sometimes, you still need factors...
  - In particular, for modeling (changing reference levels, etc) and plotting (reordering elements)
 

* wrangling categorical data in R : <https://github.com/dsscollection/factor-mgmt/blob/master/analysis/working_with_factors.pdf> 

* package - **forcats** <https://forcats.tidyverse.org/>

Level manipulation functions  
values change to match levels

* fct_**recode()** Relabel levels "by hand"
* fct_**relevel()** Reorder levels "by hand"
* fct_**reorder()** Reorder levels by another variable
* fct_**collapse()** Collapse levels "by hand"
* fct_**lump()** Lump levels with small counts together
* fct_**other()** Replace levels with "Other"

* R Syntax Comparison:: cheat sheet
Scroll to the bottom and find the **Factors with forcats Cheat Sheet** <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>

```{r example of forcats, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
summary(GSS$OpinionOfIncome)
GSS <- GSS %>%
    mutate(tidyOpinionOfIncome = 
               fct_relevel(OpinionOfIncome,
                           "Far above average",
                           "Above average",
                           "Below average",
                           "Far below average"))
summary(GSS$tidyOpinionOfIncome)


```

* **defensive coding**  
* summary(), summary(), summary()
* Certain testing function 

### Takeaways:
• Use forcats
• Practice defensive coding
• **summary()** is your friend
• assertthat and testthat

# 16: Pagedown: Creating Beautiful PDFs with R Markdown + CSS by Yihui Xie 

[pagedown_github](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown)  * <https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown>

slide : <http://bit.ly/pagedown>

 **In HTML and the Web I trust.**

It is easier parsing HTML than parsing PDF.

HTML and CSS will soon catch up the Typesetting style in Latex but it is difficult for Latex or Word to catch up in other aspects in HTML, such as the interactivity. 

### Installation
You can install from CRAN (an initial version has been released), but this package is only two months old. You are recommended to install from Github:

> remotes::install_github($\color{red}{\text{'rstudio/pagedown'}}$)

This package requires Pandoc 2.x, which is currently bundled in RStudio 1.2.x (you may install the preview version of RStudio).

Google Chrome or Chromium is recommended to view and print HTML pages generated from this package.

### Who is your audience?

 - Present (distracted) me

 - Future (6 months later) me

 - Quantitative colleagues / reviewers

 - Decision makers (may not be quantitative)
 
### Rule of three
 
 * Copy & paste code ≥3 times?
    - Write and use a function

 * Perform analysis across ≥ 3 endpoints?
    - Multiple markdown reports?
    - NOPE. ***Parameterised*** reports.
    
```{r example_conditional_display_code, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
### Hide code if we're not rendering the report for quantitative audience.
if (!params$quantAudience) knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r parameter_run, eval = params$p, echo=TRUE}
### Hide code if we're not rendering the report for quantitative audience.
data %>% 
    head(10)

```

# 19 Visualizing uncertainty with hypothetical outcomes plots 
[Claus Wilke](https://serialmentor.com/)

Tools for visualizing uncertainty with ggplot2: <https://wilkelab.org/ungeviz/>

* Hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs) are a great way of communicating uncertainty to non-experts.

* Hadley’s challenge poses three questions  
1. How do we generate outcomes?  

    - Bayesian MCMC sampling (tidybayes)
    - Bootstrapping/resampling input data
    - Normal approximation to sampling distribution

2. How do we get them into ggplot?  
    - Use package-ungeviz
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(ungeviz)
```
    
3. Is there anything to be done?

# 22: pkgman: A fresh approach to package installation 
[Gábor Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi) <https://github.com/gaborcsardi>

R-package: **pak** <https://github.com/r-lib/pak>

* The main goals of pkgman is to make package installation fast and more reliable. This allows new, simpler and safer workflows, such as separate package libraries for projects.

* pak installs R packages from CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub, and local files and directories. It is an alternative to install.packages() and devtools::install_github(). pak is fast, safe and convenient.


### Installation

Install the package from CRAN:


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("pak")
```

(After installation, you might also want to run `pak::pak_setup()`; it’ll be run automatically when needed but you might want to do it now to save some time later.)

### Usage

Call `pkg_install()` to install CRAN or Bioconductor packages:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("usethis")
```

To install GitHub packages, use the `user/repo` syntax:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("r-lib/usethis")
```

All dependencies will be installed as well, to the same library.

### Why pak?

#### Fast

* Fast downloads and HTTP queries. pak performs all HTTP requests concurrently.

* Fast installs. pak builds and installs packages concurrently.

* Metadata and package cache. pak caches package metadata and all downloaded packages locally. It does not download the same package files over and over again.

* Lazy installation. pak only installs the packages that are really necessary for the installation. If the requested package and its dependencies are already installed, pak does nothing.

#### Safe  

* Private library (pak’s own package dependencies do not affect your regular package libraries and vice versa).

* Every pak operation runs in a sub-process, and the packages are loaded from the private library. pak avoids loading packages from your regular package libraries. (These package files would be locked on some systems, and locked packages cannot be updated. pak does not load any package in the main process, except for pak itself).

* To avoid updating locked packages, pak warns and requests confirmation for loaded packages.

* Dependency solver. pak makes sure that you end up in a consistent, working state of dependencies. If finds conflicts up front, before attempting installation.

#### Convenient

* BioC packages. pak supports Bioconductor packages out of the box. It uses the Bioconductor version that is appropriate for your R version.

* GitHub packages. pak supports GitHub packages out of the box. It also supports the ``Remotes` entry in `DESCRIPTION` files, so that GitHub dependencies of GitHub packages will also get installed. See e.g. <https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes/vignettes/dependencies.html>

* Package sizes. For CRAN packages pak shows the total sizes of packages it needs to download.


### Summary and Links

* Goal 1: cheap and reliable package installation

* Goal 2: project centered work flows

* pak Features: fast(er), (more) reliable, (more) convenient

* Installation:

`source("https://install-github.me/r-lib/pak")`

* Repository:

### Basic terminology: projects and spaces

A **project** is a fundamental unit of work.

A **space** is a place for a group of people to collaborate on work.


#### Basic terminology: roles

* **Admin**: can view, manage and edit all projects, manage space membership, and delete the space itself. **Good for: System Administrator**

* **Moderator**: can view, manage, and edit all projects in the space. **Good for: project lead**

* **Contributor**: seee public projects in the space, and create new projects in the space. **Good for: project memeber/students.**

#### Basic terminology: visibility

A project can be **public** or **private**.

* Private projects in a space can be viewed by the author *and* space admins and moderators. 

* Provate projects have a lock icon.

#### Summary

RStudio Cloud: Not *just* for education

We create RStudio Cloud to make it easy for professionals, hobbyists, trainers, teachers and students to do, share, teach and learn data science using R.
